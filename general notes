**update**
-Researching provisioners: want to add a ruby based bootstrap.sh to the vagrant_file's folder to run at vagrant_up.
-Will also have to edit the vagrant file config.
-This can be written and configured to export running services each time the vm spins up.

<note> probably won't have time to learn the script before 4pm, but will have time to learn the method of implementation into vagrant.
