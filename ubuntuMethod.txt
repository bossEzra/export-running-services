#Trying line by line on ubuntu for fun
#The idea here is to write the basic shell script in the console.

#enter line by line
-------------------

#writes the .sh. first arg tells that each is a new line.
printf '%s\n' 'sudo su' 'service --status-all' >sServ.sh

#makes exe
chmod +x sServ.sh

#runs .sh and exports to txt.
./sServ.sh >sServ.txt
